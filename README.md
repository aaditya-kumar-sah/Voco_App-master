Problem:
Visually impaired individuals have very limited access to vocational training because most training platforms are not designed with strong accessibility features. Offline training is also difficult due to mobility challenges, linguistic barriers, and lack of inclusive learning environments. As a result, many visually impaired people struggle to develop job skills, communicate confidently, and achieve independence.

Solution:
A web/app-based accessible vocational training platform that uses voice-powered navigation, audio-based learning materials, pronunciation training, live expert sessions, chatbot support, and interactive games. The platform is designed with accessibility-first UI, offline-first capability (PWA approach), and community features like real-time user interaction and expert guidance, helping visually impaired users build skills, improve communication, and gain better employment opportunities.
